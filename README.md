# Red light, green light game for an Adafruit Flora

I have been wanting to try making something with circuits for a while, but have been a bit intimidated. Then I discovered conductive thread and [Adafruit FLORA](https://www.adafruit.com/product/659) parts at a local library's makerspace.

This is the code for a red light, green light game that I made for my nieces, who are 6 and 4 years old. It randomly cycles through red, yellow, and green light mode at random intervals between 1-2.5 seconds long. There's a special "purple light" mode that flashes all of the LEDs purpleâ€”that's when the players are supposed to do a silly dance. 

This tutorial was helpful to learn how to use conductive thread: https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-accelerometer/wiring-with-conductive-thread
